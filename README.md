- hot-reloading in development mode
- deployment (staging, production)
- support ES6 syntax
- support absolute import
- simple, configurable, and extendable

WHY this repo exist
I am a real fan of firebase services. I love cloud functions because it connects other firebase services together which allow us 
to create magical things. However, we have to write it in ES5 and it annoyed me a lot. Fotunately, I found this that explain
how to use ES6 in cloud functions. But it is not enough, because I want to use it in dev and production too. So, I made a little changes with
some hacky things to make hot-reloading and continuous deployment available. I hope this project can save you some time. Feel free to suggest and comment.
